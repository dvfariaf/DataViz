## Storytelling with data - Cole Nussbaumer knaflic

***

### think like a designer

> Form follows function

* first think about what it is we want our audience to do with the data (function)
* then create a visualization (form) that will alow for this with ease



#### Affordances
Leverage visual affordances to indicate to our audience how to use and interact with our visualizations


##### 1. Highlight the important stuff
draw audience attention to where you want them too.

* Max 10% of content highlighted. If not highlighting will be diluted.

* When highlighting TEXT, these should be preferred:
    + __bold__ over **italic**
    + CASE
    + color (great with bold)
  
* These should be used sparingly
    + and use <span style="text-decoration:underline">underline</span> sparingly.
    + typeface (changing fonts to attract attention)
    + Inversing background and font color.

*  Never use
    + Blinking or flashing (tends to be annoying more than helpful)
  
* On visuals
    + Use colors carefully. It is a good idea to highlight with an outstanding color **exclusively** the information that supports our argument
  
  
  
##### 2. Eliminate distractions

> “La perfection est atteinte, non pas lorsqu'il n'y a plus rien à ajouter, mais lorsqu'il n'y a plus rien à retirer.” - Antoine de Saint-Exupery, 1943

__Clutter__ - information that takes space but does not support your message - is your enemy.

__Context__ - what needs to be present for your audience so the message makes sense - is your purpose

Take into account that:

* Use space and audience's attention wisely to __get rid of noncritical data__ (not all data is equaly important)
* Consider summarizing when appropriate: __You know the details, your audience might not need to__.
* Eliminating this would change anything? Yes? leave it. No? __take it out!__. (If it not supports the message, it doesn't serve the purpose)
* Ok, it is necessary... but non-message-impacting? __push it to the background__. Grey is great for this.



##### 3. Create a clear hierarchy of information

Indicate to your audience the order in which they should process information you are communicating.

Whenever that data contains super-categories or groups, **make them clear first** so your audience know how to interpret lower categories.
